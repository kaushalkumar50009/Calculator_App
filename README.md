# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Certainly, here's a README template for your calculator code:

# Calculator App

This is a simple calculator application built using React. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, keep a history of calculations, and clear the input.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** You can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- **History:** The calculator keeps a history of your calculations, showing the previous expressions and their results.

- **Clear Functionality:** You can clear the input either one character at a time or clear everything at once.

- **Error Handling:** The calculator handles basic error cases, such as division by zero.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

3. Install the required dependencies using the following command:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the development server:

    ```
    npm start
    ```

5. Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to use the calculator.

## Usage

- To perform arithmetic operations, click the number buttons, followed by an operator (+, -, x, /), and then click another number button. Click "=" to see the result.

- To clear one character at a time, click the "back" button.

- To clear everything, click the "clear all" button.

## Built With

- React: The JavaScript library used to build the user interface.
